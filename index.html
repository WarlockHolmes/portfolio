      <div class="pt-3">
        <div class="col-10 mx-auto">
          <p>Since a young age, Morgan has been exploring as many creative media as he could get his hands on: writing, acting, film, multiple musical instruments, even building rudimentary video games on PowerPoint. He took a leadership role as he grew older as captain of his school's improv team, team leader for the <a href="https://fringetheatre.ca"> International Fringe Festival</a>'s "KidsFringe" area, and even taught professional theatre workshops before graduating high school. In 2016 he received a Bachelor's Degree of Fine Arts in Acting (with distinction) from the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/drama/undergraduate/bfa-acting/index.html">University of Alberta</a>, and has been producing and performing his and others' independent theatre ever since.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Beyond his work as an artist, Morgan has been teaching in various capacities for almost a decade. At the age of 16 he helped organize and taught at a theatre summer camp called Camp Spotlight. A year later he joined Edmonton's pre-eminent improvised theatre company <a href="https://rapidfiretheatre.com/">Rapid Fire Theatre</a>, where he taught workshops to high school students and adults alike. He's also taught drama at Edmonton's YMCA, as well as history and ecology through the Muttart Conservatory, the John Janzen Nature Center, and the John Walter Museum (all located in Edmonton as well). Most recently, he worked for three years in an educational capacity at Alberta's provincial Legislature.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In 2020 he pursued an education in full stack web development through <a href="https://altcademy.com">altcademy</a>. He speaks HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, Python, and GameMaker Language (and is fluent in French as well).</p>
